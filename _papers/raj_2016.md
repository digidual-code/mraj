Graphs are powerful and versatile data structures that can be used to represent a wide range of different
types of information. In this article, we introduce a method to analyze and then visualize an important class
of data described over a graphâ€”namely, ensembles of paths. Analysis of such path ensembles is useful in a
variety of applications, in diverse fields such as transportation, computer networks, and molecular dynamics.
The proposed method generalizes the concept of band depth to an ensemble of paths on a graph, which
provides a center-outward ordering on the paths. This ordering is, in turn, used to construct a generalization
of the conventional boxplot or whisker plot, called a path boxplot, which applies to paths on a graph. The
utility of path boxplot is demonstrated for several examples of path ensembles including paths defined over
computer networks and roads. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.
