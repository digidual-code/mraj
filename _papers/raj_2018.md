This paper presents a novel method for layout of undirected graphs, where nodes
(vertices) are constrained to lie on a set of nested, simple, closed curves.
Such a layout is useful to simultaneously display the structural centrality and
vertex distance information for graphs in many domains, including social
networks. Closed curves are a more general constraint than the previously
proposed circles, and afford our method more flexibility to preserve vertex
relationships compared to existing radial layout methods. The proposed approach
modifies the multidimensional scaling (MDS) stress to include the estimation of
a vertex depth or centrality field as well as a term that penalizes discord
between structural centrality of vertices and their alignment with this
carefully estimated field. We also propose a visualization strategy for the
proposed layout and demonstrate its effectiveness using three social network
datasets.
