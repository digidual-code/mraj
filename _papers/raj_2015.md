The visualization of variability in surfaces embedded in 3D, which is a type of
ensemble uncertainty visualization, provides a means of understanding the
underlying distribution of a collection or ensemble of surfaces. This work
extends the contour boxplot technique to 3D and evaluates it against an
enumeration-style visualization of the ensemble members and other conventional
visualizations used by atlas builders. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of
using the 3D contour boxplot ensemble visualization technique to analyze shape
alignment and variability in atlas construction and analysis as a real-world
application.
