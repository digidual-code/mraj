Multidimensional data sets are common in many domains, and dimensionality
reduction methods that determine a lower dimensional embedding are widely used
for visualizing such data sets. This paper presents a novel method to project
data onto a lower dimensional space by taking into account the order statistics
of the individual data points, which are quantified by their depth or
centrality in the overall set. Thus, in addition to conveying relative
distances in the data, the proposed method also preserves the order statistics,
which are often lost or misrepresented by existing visualization methods. The
proposed method entails a modification of the optimization objective of
conventional multidimensional scaling (MDS) by introducing a term that
penalizes discrepancies between centrality structures in the original space and
the embedding. We also introduce two strategies for visualizing lower
dimensional embeddings of multidimensional data that takes advantage of the
coherent representation of centrality provided by the proposed projection
method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our visualization with comparisons
on different kinds of multidimensional data, including categorical and
multimodal, from a variety of domains such as botany and health care.
