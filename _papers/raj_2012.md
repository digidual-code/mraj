Gesture-based controllers such as the Microsoft Kinect are low cost devices
that allow a user to interact with complex, threedimensional simulations using
an interface argued to be more natural than game controllers, joy sticks, or a
mouse and keyboard. This paper presents a controlled experimental evaluation of
the use of Microsoft Kinect to support a 3D object manipulation task. Users
were asked to match the orientation of objects with a manipulation interface
that displayed either a self-avatar hand and arm or a sphere, both
corresponding to usersâ€™ arm gestures and wrist rotation. Our results show that
while there was no overall difference in performance between the self-avatar
and sphere visual display conditions, there were clear differences in the two
visual display conditions as a function of gender and video-game experience.
