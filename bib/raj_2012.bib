abstract = {Gesture-based controllers such as the Microsoft Kinect are low cost devices that allow
a user to interact with complex, three-dimensional simulations using an interface
argued to be more natural than game controllers, joy sticks, or a mouse and keyboard.
This paper presents a controlled experimental evaluation of the use of Microsoft Kinect
to support a 3D object manipulation task. Users were asked to match the orientation
of objects with a manipulation interface that displayed either a self-avatar hand
and arm or a sphere, both corresponding to users' arm gestures and wrist rotation.
Our results show that while there was no overall difference in performance between
the self-avatar and sphere visual display conditions, there were clear differences
in the two visual display conditions as a function of gender and video-game experience.},
